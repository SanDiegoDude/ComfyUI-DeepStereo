## Installation

1. Clone this repository into your ComfyUI `custom_nodes` directory:
```bash
cd /path/to/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ComfyUI-DeepStereo-Nodes.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
cd ComfyUI-DeepStereo-Nodes
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Restart ComfyUI

**Note**: This extension requires PyTorch, which should already be installed with ComfyUI. If you encounter torch-related issues, ensure your ComfyUI installation includes proper CUDA support for GPU acceleration.

## Quick Start

### Recommended Workflow
1. **Depth Map Creation**:
   - **Load Image** â†’ **MiDaS Depth Estimator**
   - Use DPT_Large model for best quality
   - Adjust contrast, brightness, and depth range
   - Enable depth normalization for optimal results

2. **Texture Generation** (choose one):
   - **Random Noise Generator**:
     - Set pattern_width to match max_separation (default 100)
     - Try kaleidoscope, crystalline, or interference patterns
     - Enable seamless tiling
   - **Procedural Texture Generator**:
     - Use content-driven patterns
     - Apply texture transformation if needed

3. **Stereogram Creation**:
   - Use **Stereogram Generator** with:
     - Algorithm: "central"
     - Reference type: "center_out"
     - Depth layers: 50
     - Layer smoothing: 1.0
   - Or try **Random Dot Stereogram Generator** for classic effects

### Advanced Techniques
- **Pattern Enhancement**:
  - Use Image Effects for sharper, more defined patterns
  - Try different blend modes for unique effects
  - Adjust pattern frequency and color variation

- **Depth Optimization**:
  - Fine-tune depth layers for desired 3D effect
  - Use gamma correction for depth emphasis
  - Apply subtle blur for smoother transitions

- **Texture Tips**:
  - Avoid blurry or overly complex patterns
  - Use high contrast for better depth perception
  - Keep pattern size consistent with separation values
